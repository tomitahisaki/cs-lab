This directory contains a basic implementation of **Linear Search**,  
one of the simplest search algorithms.  
The goal is to practice Go by implementing fundamental CS concepts.

## 🔍 What is Linear Search?

Linear Search checks elements **one by one from the beginning** of a list.  
It returns the index of the first matching value, or a fallback value when the
target is not found.

Characteristics:

- Easy to implement  
- Works on unsorted lists  
- **Time Complexity: O(N)**  
  — Processing time grows linearly with the number of elements
